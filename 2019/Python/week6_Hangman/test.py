    The speed_check function checks the speed of drivers.

    1. If the speed is less than 60 it should return OK
    2. Otherwise, for each 5km above the speed limit of 60 
        the driver loses one demerit point. 
        Example: If the speed recorded is 80 the function returns:

    3. If the driver gets more than 12 demerit points the function
        returns "SUSPENDED!"
